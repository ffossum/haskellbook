#Exercises: Grab Bag

Note the following exercises are from source code files, not written for use directly in the REPL. Of course, you can change them to test directly in the REPL if you prefer.

1. Which (two or more) of the following are equivalent?
a) `mTh x y z = x * y * z`
b) `mTh x y = \z -> x * y * z`
c) `mTh x = \y -> \z -> x * y * z`
d) `mTh = \x -> \y -> \z -> x * y * z`

    Answer: They are all equivalent, because all functions are curried.

2. The type of `mTh` (above) is `Num a => a -> a -> a -> a`.
Which is the type of `mTh 3`?
a) `Integer -> Integer -> Integer`
b) `Num a => a -> a -> a -> a`
c) `Num a => a -> a`
d) `Num a => a -> a -> a`

    Answer: d)

3. Next, we’ll practice writing anonymous lambda syntax.
For example, one could rewrite:

    ```haskell
    addOne x = x + 1
    ```

    Into:

    ```haskell
    addOne = \x -> x + 1
    ```

    Try to make it so it can still be loaded as a top-level definition by GHCi. This will make it easier to validate your answers.

    a) Rewrite the f function in the where clause.

    ```haskell
    addOneIfOdd n = case odd n of
        True -> f n
        False -> n
        where f n = n + 1
    ```
    Answer:
    ```haskell
    addOneIfOdd n = case odd n of
        True -> f n
        False -> n
        where f = (\n -> n + 1)
    ```

    b) Rewrite the following to use anonymous lambda syntax:

    ```haskell
    addFive x y = (if x > y then y else x) + 5
    ```
    Answer:
    ```haskell
    addFive = (\x y -> (if x > y then y else x) + 5)
    ```

    c) Rewrite the following so that it doesn’t use anonymous lambda syntax:

    ```haskell
    mflip f = \x -> \y -> f y x
    ```
    Answer:
    ```haskell
    mflip f x y = f y x
    ```
