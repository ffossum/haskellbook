# Exercises: Understanding Folds

1. `foldr (*) 1 [1..5]`
    will return the same result as which of the following:

    a) `flip (*) 1 [1..5]`
    b) `foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..5]`
    c) `foldl (*) 1 [1..5]`

    Answer: b) and c). `foldl`/`foldr` and `flip`/no `flip` doesn't matter because `(*)` is associative.


2. Write out the evaluation steps for
`foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3]`
    Answer:
    ```haskell
    f = flip (*)

    (((1 `f` 1) `f` 2) `f` 3)
     ((1 `f` 2) `f` 3)
      (2 `f` 3)
       1
    ```
3. One difference between `foldr` and `foldl` is:
a) `foldr`, but not `foldl`, traverses the spine of a list from right to left
b) `foldr`, but not `foldl`, always forces the rest of the fold
**c) `foldr`, but not `foldl`, associates to the right**
d) `foldr`, but not `foldl`, is recursive

4. Folds are catamorphisms, which means they are generally used to
**a) reduce structure**
b) expand structure
c) render you catatonic
d) generate infinite data structures

5. The following are simple folds very similar to what youâ€™ve already seen, but each has at least one error. Please fix them and test in your REPL:

a) `foldr (++) ["woot", "WOOT", "woot"]`
Answer: `foldr (++) "" ["woot", "WOOT", "woot"]`

b) `foldr max [] "fear is the little death"`
Answer: `foldr max minBound "fear is the little death"`

c) `foldr and True [False, True]`
Answer: `foldr (&&) True [False, True]`

d) This one is more subtle than the previous. Can it ever return a different answer?
`foldr (||) True [False, True]`
Answer:
`foldr (||) False [False, True]`

e) `foldl ((++) . show) "" [1..5]`
Answer:
`foldl (flip ((++) . show)) "" [1..5]`
or
`foldr ((++) . show) "" [1..5]`

f) `foldr const 'a' [1..5]`
Answer: `foldr (flip const) 'a' [1..5]`

g) `foldr const 0 "tacos"`
Answer: `foldr (flip const) 0 "tacos"`

h) `foldl (flip const) 0 "burritos"`
Answer: `foldl const 0 "burritos"`

i) `foldl (flip const) 'z' [1..5]`
Answer: `foldl const 'z' [1..5]`
