## Multiple choice

(Answers in bold)

1. Given the following datatype:
    ```haskell
    data Weekday =
        Monday
      | Tuesday
      | Wednesday
      | Thursday
      | Friday
    ```
    we can say:
    **a) Weekday is a type with five data constructors**
    b) Weekday is a tree with five branches
    c) Weekday is a product type
    d) Weekday takes five arguments

2. and with the same datatype definition in mind, what is the type of the following function, `f`?

    ```haskell
    f Friday = "Miller Time"
    ```

    a) `f :: [Char]`
    b) `f :: String -> String`
    **c) `f :: Weekday -> String`**
    d) `f :: Day -> Beer`

3. Types defined with the data keyword

    a) must have at least one argument
    **b) must begin with a capital letter**
    c) must be polymorphic
    d) cannot be imported from modules

4. The function `g xs = xs !! (length xs - 1)`
a) is recursive and may not terminate
b) delivers the head of xs
**c) delivers the final element of xs**
d) has the same type as xs

## As-patterns

Use as-patterns in implementing the following functions:

1. This should return `True` if (and only if) all the values in the
first list appear in the second list, though they need not be
contiguous.

```haskell
isSubseqOf :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
```
Remember that the sub-sequence has to be in the original order!

Answer:
```haskell
isSubseqOf :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
isSubseqOf [] _ = True
isSubseqOf _ [] = False
isSubseqOf as@(ah:at) (bh:bt) = if ah == bh
  then isSubseqOf at bt
  else isSubseqOf as bt
```

2. Split a sentence into words, then tuple each word with the capitalized form of each.

```haskell
capitalizeWords :: String -> [(String, String)]
```
```
Prelude> capitalizeWords "hello world"
[("hello", "Hello"), ("world", "World")]
```

Answer:
```haskell
capitalizeWords :: String -> [(String, String)]
capitalizeWords = (map f) . words
  where
    f x@(h:t) = (x, (toUpper h) : t)
```
